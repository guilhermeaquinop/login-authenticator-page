<h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

In this project I developed my first login authentication using php and database. The actions are basic: register and log in, with a validation that does not allow you to have more than one registration with the same e-mail.

If you want access to the project, click on this link: https://login-authenticator-page.herokuapp.com/, (unfortunately, I still can't get the application's server to work on the hosting).
